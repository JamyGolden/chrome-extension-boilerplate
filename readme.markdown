## Installation instructions

### General installation
Open drag the CSS-Tricks-Mod/extension/CSS-Tricks-Mod.crx file into your Chrome settings -> extensions window. This should ask you to install the plugin.

### Development installation (OSx/Linux)
* Install nodejs and sass/compass
* Navigate to the root CSS-Tricks-Mod folder (Don't rename that folder)
* $ ./build/temp/build.sh
* That will create a "CSS-Tricks-Mod/public" folder
* Go to Chrome settings -> extensions and tick "Developer mode"
* Click the "Load unpacked extension" button and select the "CSS-Tricks-Mod" folder
* It should load the plugin
